7. How does Cloud Computing help IoT devices? _Select two_.
    - Draw insights from data collected from the IoT devices and users
    - Provide the resources to store and process the data produced by IoT devices and users
    - Minimize latency in reporting and responding to data collected through IoT sensors from around the world
    - Provide a fixed physical location for the data collected from IoT devices
    ```
    Answer: Provide the resources to store and process the data produced by IoT devices and users,
            Minimize latency in reporting and responding to data collected through IoT sensors from around the world
    Explanation: IoT devices are generating unprecedented amounts of data around the world, and the cloud provides the resources to gather, store, and process this data.
                 Since IoT devices can be in a state of motion, the cloud serves as a collection point in closest proximity, minimizing the latency in reporting up the data points and providing a response back to the IoT application.
    ```

8. Which of these statements best reflects the symbiotic relationship between AI and IoT on the Cloud?
    - AI helps make sense of the endless streams of data from IoT devices
    - AI consumes data produced by IoT devices. Based on conclusions drawn by AI algorithms on patterns emerging this data, IoT devices learn to anticipate user actions based on past actions and respond to them based on their preferences.
    - AI and IoT platforms leverage the power, scale, dynamic nature, and economics of the cloud resources.
    - AI consumes the data produced by IoT devices and users.
    ```
    Answer: AI consumes data produced by IoT devices. Based on conclusions drawn by AI algorithms on patterns emerging this data, IoT devices learn to anticipate user actions based on past actions and respond to them based on their preferences.
    Explanation: This is how AI and IoT support and extend each other’s capabilities on the cloud.
