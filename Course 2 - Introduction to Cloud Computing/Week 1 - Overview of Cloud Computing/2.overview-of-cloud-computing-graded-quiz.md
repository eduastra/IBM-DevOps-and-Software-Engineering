# Overview of Cloud Computing: Graded Quiz

1. In the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition of “cloud computing”, what does the statement “shared pool of configurable computing resources” include?
    - Five essential characteristics, three deployment models, three service models
    - Leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider
    - Networks, servers, storage, applications, and services
    - Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
    ```
    Answer: Networks, servers, storage, applications, and services
    Explanation: These are all recognized as computing resources that can be configured as needed and shared.
    ```

2. What tasks do hypervisors accomplish? _Select two_.
    - Enable multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources.
    - Scale on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
    - Separates VMs logically and assigns each a share of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage.
    - Facilitate access to mainframes for multiple users to access the same data storage layer.
    ```
    Answer: Enable multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources,
            Separates VMs logically and assigns each a share of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage.
    Explanation: A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources.
                 Hypervisors also separate virtual machines logically, assigning each its ow slice of the underlying computing power, memory and storage, preventing the virtual machines from interfering with each other.

3. What are some of the cloud benefits that make it lower-risk for enterprises to adopt cloud? _Select two_.
    - Diversity of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate.
    - Data security associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
    - The pay-as-you-go model allows enterprises to experiment with technologies as opposed to making long-term decisions based on little or no trial.
    - The speed with which applications can be up and running on the cloud versus months on traditional platforms, means enterprises can experiment, fail fast, learn, and course correct without setting them back significantly.
    ```
    Answer: The pay-as-you-go model allows enterprises to experiment with technologies as opposed to making long-term decisions based on little or no trial,
            The speed with which applications can be up and running on the cloud versus months on traditional platforms, means enterprises can experiment, fail fast, learn, and course correct without setting them back significantly.
    Explanation: Renting by the hour as opposed to the huge upfront cost of investing and re-investing in hardware and software makes cloud adoption a low-risk option for enterprises.
                 The speed and productivity provided by the cloud make cloud adoption lower-risk for enterprises.

    B.     Amazon Web Services

    C.     Google Cloud Platform

    D.     Microsoft Azure

    - A, B, C, and D
    - A only
    - A and B only
    - A, B, and C only
    ```
    Answer: A, B, C, and D
    Explanation: IBM, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure—all provide full-service cloud offerings.
    ```

5. An IBM Institute for Business Value study says that more than three-quarters of enterprises today are using cloud computing to expand into new industries. What additional benefits do organizations find when adopting the cloud:
    - Continue making expensive decisions because it often worked in the past 
    - Improve customer experience and create enhanced products and services
    - Lengthen product lifecycles to ensure higher quality offerings
    - Avoid having to fail at all
    ```
    Answer: Improve customer experience and create enhanced products and services
    Explanation: Cloud enables businesses to respond quickly to marketplace changes, use analytics to understand customer experience, and to apply that understanding to adapt their products and service from what they learn.
    ```

6. What are some of the results companies like Bitly, American Airlines, UBank, and ActivTrades achieve with cloud adoption?

    A.     Better customer service

    B.     Remove barriers to innovation

    C.     Demand for enterprise scale

    D.     Accelerating growth

    - A and B only
    - B and D only
    - C and D only
    - A, B, C, and D
    ```
    Answer: A, B, C, and D
    Explanation: All are correct.
    ```

7. IoT, AI, Blockchain, and Analytics are emerging technologies enabled by the cloud. What are some of the attributes of cloud computing that enable these technologies? _Select two_.
    - The power and scale of cloud resources
    - Cloud resources are offered in a single-tenant model
    - Computing resources can be accessed via internet connection
    - Cloud offers on-demand computing
    ```
    Answer: The power and scale of cloud resources,
            Cloud offers on-demand computing
    Explanation: Emerging technologies such as IoT, AI, Blockchain, and Analytics process and generate an unprecedented amount of data. Cloud provides the scalability and processing power required to gather, store, and process this data.
                 Cloud resources scale up and down in response to the workload demand, with users paying only for resources that they use. This makes it cost-viable for organizations to leverage emerging technologies on the cloud.
    ```

8. What is the three-way symbiotic relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud?
    - Making sense of the endless streams of data from IoT devices
    - IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both emerging technologies leverage cloud's scalability and processing power
    - Power, scale, dynamic nature, and economics of the cloud resources
    - AI consumes the data produced by IoT devices
    ```
    Answer: IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both emerging technologies leverage cloud's scalability and processing power
    Explanation: This is the three-way relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud.
    ```

9. What is the three-way relationship between blockchain, AI, and the Cloud?
    - Globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources.
    - Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from the collected data, and cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to support both technologies.
    - Lends trust and transparency to AI by recording the data and variables that go into a decision made in an AI algorithm.
    - Blockchain provides an immutable network allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them.
    ```
    Answer: Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from the collected data, and cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to support both technologies.

    - Single-tenant
    - Resource pooling
    - On-demand self-service
    ```
    Answer: Resource pooling,
            On-demand self-service
    Explanation: Cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, according to demand, without consumers needing to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.
                 Users can access cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network using a simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
