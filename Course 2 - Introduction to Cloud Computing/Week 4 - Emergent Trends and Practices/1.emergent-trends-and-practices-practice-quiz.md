# Emergent Trends and Practices: Practice Quiz

1. In the use case illustrated in the video, how does the global flower delivery company leverage the Hybrid Multicloud architecture to meet its requirement of varying capacity demands across different geographies?
    - By scaling up their on-premise architecture 
    - By using the automatic provisioning and de-provisioning of resources that cloud offers 
    - By distributing their delivery service application across multiple cloud environments and providers, spread across multiple geographies
    ```
    Answer: By distributing their delivery service application across multiple cloud environments and providers, spread across multiple geographies
    Explanation: Moving their UI and Billing capabilities over to a North American Public Cloud Data Center, while their core application continues to reside in an on-premise data center in Europe, allowed the flower delivery company to scale up portions of their application in response to a surge in demand over the American holidays.
    ```

2. Which one of these is an attribute of the microservices architecture approach?
    - When one of the microservices of an application stops to function, it disrupts the functioning of the complete application 
    - Every new functionality in a microservice needs to be developed from scratch 
    - All the microservices that need to perform a task, need to be bundled in a single container so that they can perform the assigned task 
    - Microservices breakdown large applications into their core functions to create a fully functional application 
    ```
    Answer: Microservices breakdown large applications into their core functions to create a fully functional application
    Explanation: Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components or services. 
    ```

3. Which of these scenarios is NOT a good use case for serverless architecture?
    - Workloads characterized by long-running processes 
    - Stream processing workloads
    - Supporting microservices architecture 
    - Microservices that can be built as functions that are stateless 
    ```
    Answer: Workloads characterized by long-running processes
    Explanation: For workloads characterized by long-running processes, managing a traditional server environment might be simpler and more cost-effective.
    ```

4. Cloud native applications follow a consistent set of development principles. _Identify two_ of these development principles from the provided options.
    - Containerize the microservices for maximum flexibility, scalability, and portability 
    - Break applications down to single-function microservices 
    - Bring the various single-function components of an application into one huge piece of software 
    - Tightly couple the different functions of the application so that they can work together as a whole 
    ```
    Answer: Containerize the microservices for maximum flexibility, scalability, and portability,
            Break applications down to single-function microservices.
    Explanation: Each microservice in a cloud native application is packaged with its libraries and dependencies into individual containers,
                 Cloud native applications follow the microservices architectural approach of breaking down an application into independent loosely coupled single-function microservices.
    ```

5. Which of the following statements describe the DevOps approach and process? _Select two_.
    - DevOps process defines how people work together to build, deploy, and manage applications in a cloud native environment
    - A collaborative approach where business owners and development, operations, and quality assurance teams collaborate to continuously deliver software
    - Eliminates the need to monitor performance and availability
    - Eliminates the need to provision servers, build middleware, and install application code
    ```
    Answer: DevOps process defines how people work together to build, deploy, and manage applications in a cloud native environment,
            A collaborative approach where business owners and development, operations, and quality assurance teams collaborate to continuously deliver software.
    Explanation: Cloud native applications form a complex distributed system with multiple moving parts, independent tech stacks, and rapid release cycles. The DevOps defines the process that helps teams work in the cloud native environment,
                 DevOps approach applies agile and lean thinking principles to all stakeholders in an organization who develop, operate, or benefit from the businessâ€™s software systems, including customers, suppliers, partners.
    ```

6. Which of the provided options encapsulates the complete application modernization journey?
    - The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture. 
    - The journey from waterfall and agile development methodologies to DevOps. 
    - The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture, from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure, and from waterfall and agile methodology to DevOps. 
    - The journey from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure. 
    ```
    Answer: The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture, from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure, and from waterfall and agile methodology to DevOps. 
    Explanation: Application modernization involves the modernization of application architecture, infrastructure, and development and operations processes.
