# Components of Cloud Computing: Graded Quiz

1. Each Cloud Region can have multiple Zones (also known as Availability Zones). What are Zones?
    - Standardized containers of computing resources
    - Single shared point of failure 
    - Geographic area or region where cloud provider’s infrastructure is clustered
    - Unique physical locations with one or more data centers 
    ```
    Answer: Unique physical locations with one or more data centers 
    Explanation: Zones, or Availability Zones, are distinct locations with one or more data centers with their own power, cooling, and networking resources. 
    ```

2. Is it possible to run completely different operating systems on Virtual Machines (VMs) that are on a single host? If yes, what makes this possible?
    - Yes, Virtualization makes it possible— to have VMs, running different operating systems, on a single host. 
    - Yes, Containerization makes it possible—to have VMs that are unique physical entities, so you can have completely different Operating Systems on them. 
    - No, it is not possible—VMs are software-based versions of a single host. They cannot have different environments from one another. 
    - No, it is not possible—A single host can only work as one single virtual environment, and can, therefore, have only one environment. 
    ```
    Answer: Yes, Virtualization makes it possible— to have VMs, running different operating systems, on a single host.
    Explanation: Each VM works like an independent physical entity with its own Operating System, runtime environments and applications.
    ```
    
3. Which of the following are examples of single-tenant compute environments in the Cloud? _Select two_.
    - Reserved virtual server 
    - Transient virtual servers 
    - Dedicated host
    - Bare Metal servers
    ```
    Answer: Dedicated host,
            Bare Metal servers.
    Explanation: Dedicated hosts offer single-tenant isolation, which means only your VMs run on a given host,
                 Bare Metal servers are single-tenant physical hosts that offer a highly customizable environment for intensive workloads.
    ```
    
4. Which of these scenarios is ideal for the use of bare metal servers, as opposed to virtual servers? _Select two_.
    - CPU and I/O intensive workloads
    - Huge performance and strict security and compliance requirements
    - Low cost to use 
    - Workloads that require limited throughput and performance 
    ```
    Answer: CPU and I/O intensive workloads,
            Huge performance and strict security and compliance requirements.
    Explanation: Since bare metal servers are dedicated and fully customizable, they can do what a customer wants in the most demanding environments,
                 Bare metal servers are intended for high performance use in highly secure and isolated environments. Clients have full access and control of bare metal servers because they are dedicated for their use.
    ```
    
5. What are some key differences between Containers and Virtual Machines? _Select two_.
    - Containers can use the same OS as the host, while a virtual machine needs its own copy of the OS, which can also be different from the host OS 
    - Even though each container uses the same OS as the host OS, it still needs to have its own copy of the OS, while a virtual machine leverages the resources of the host OS 
    - Containers are more lightweight as compared to virtual machines
    - Containers are executable units of software while each virtual machine is a distinct physical entity
    ```
    Answer: Containers can use the same OS as the host, while a virtual machine needs its own copy of the OS, which can also be different from the host OS,
            Containers are more lightweight as compared to virtual machines.
    Explanation: Containers leverage the resources of the host OS, while VMs are set up to work as independent machines and can run an OS that is different from the host OS,
                 A container includes only the executables with their dependencies, while each virtual machine needs to not only have a virtual copy of the hardware but also the OS.
    ```
    
6. There are four types of cloud storage available. Which storage type is ephemeral or non-persistent?
    - Block storage 
    - File storage 
    - Direct Attached storage
    - Object storage 
    ```
    Answer: Direct Attached storage
    Explanation: Direct Attached storage, also known as "local storage", is ephemeral as it is no longer accessible once the VM its attached to is de-provisioned.
    ```
    
7. What makes File storage an ideal solution for scenarios where shared storage is needed?
    - File Storage is mounted to compute nodes via an ethernet network
    - Mounted from remote storage appliances 
    - Its consistently high speed 
    - File storage can be mounted on multiple compute nodes at the same time 
    ```
    Answer: File storage can be mounted on multiple compute nodes at the same time
    Explanation: The ability for File Storage to be mounted to multiple compute nodes at a time make it an ideal solution for shared storage requirements.
    ```
    
8. Which of these scenarios are best suited for Block Storage? _Select two_.
    - Applications that need consistent fast access to disk, such as databases
    - Low cost is a consideration
    - Workloads that need low-latency storage
    - Workloads that need disk sharing between compute nodes
    ```
    Answer: Applications that need consistent fast access to disk, such as databases,
            Workloads that need low-latency storage,
    Explanation: Fibre optic networks move traffic at consistently high speeds, making it ideal for applications that need consistent and fast access,
                 Block storage is accessed via a dedicated network of fibres through which signals move at high speed, consistently. This makes block storage suitable for low latency workloads.

    ```
    
9. Which of these are features of Object Storage? _Select two_.
    - You can directly use Object Storage without attaching it to a compute node
    - Object Storage can be mounted on multiple compute nodes via an ethernet network
    - Storage is attached to compute nodes using a fibre network
    - Object storage is effectively infinite 
    ```
    Answer: You can directly use Object Storage without attaching it to a compute node,
            Object storage is effectively infinite.
    Explanation: You don’t need an underlying compute node to connect to object storage, rather you can access it from anywhere using an API,
                 With file and block storage, you specify the size of the storage and pay a fee based on the size you provisioned. With Object Storage, you consume as much storage as you need and pay-as-you-go.
    ```
    
10. What is the main benefit of a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
    - Speed, it makes your website faster by serving files from a location closer to the user. 
    - Enhanced control over network traffic by routing traffic to specified resources 
    - Network topology 
    - Distribute tasks, workloads, and network traffic
    ```
    Answer: Speed, it makes your website faster by serving files from a location closer to the user. 
    Explanation: CDNs reduce the amount of distance between the user and the content, or the server providing the content. CDN end-points are placed close to every location where users exist to reduce the time it takes for each user to access the website. 
    ```
