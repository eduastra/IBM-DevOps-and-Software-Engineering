# Cloud Computing Models: Practice Quiz

1. In the car analogy used in the video to explain and differentiate between the three service models, which of the provided options is an analogy for PaaS?
    - Renting a car
    - Hiring a taxi
    - Buying a car
    - Leasing a car
    ```
    Answer: Renting a car
    Explanation: Renting a car is likened to the PaaS model in this analogy. The customer is driving the car, paying for the gas and toll expense but is not concerned about the specifications of the car.
    ```

2. According to the IaaS video, which one of these is NOT a likely use case for IaaS? 
    - High-performance computing
    - Retaining in-house control over workload availability and performance 
    - Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
    - Big Data Analysis
    ```
    Answer: Retaining in-house control over workload availability and performance
    Explanation: For an organization looking for greater control over the configuration, management, workload availability, and performance of their infrastructure, it is unlikely that they would opt for IaaS.
    ```
    
3. Which of these scenarios are good use cases for PaaS. _Select two_.
    - API Development and Management
    - Organizations who want to maintain full control over the installation, configuration, and operation of their application infrastructure
    - Organizations who do not want to invest in ongoing upgrades and maintenance of their applications
    - Build, test, deploy, enhance, and scale applications rapidly and cost-effectively
    ```
    Answer: API Development and Management,
            Build, test, deploy, enhance, and scale applications rapidly and cost-effectively
    Explanation: Organizations are using PaaS to develop, run, manage, and secure APIs and microservices,
                 PaaS clouds are distinguished by the high level of abstraction they provide to the users, eliminating the complexity of building, testing, deploying, updating, and scaling applications.
    ```
    
4. Which one of the following is a good use case for SaaS?
    - Business-critical applications
    - Applications that have highly confidential and sensitive data
    - Organizations that have a geographically spread workforce, some of them working in areas with erratic or unreliable internet connections
    - Organizations looking to reduce on-premises IT infrastructure and capital expenditure
    ```
    Answer: Organizations looking to reduce on-premises IT infrastructure and capital expenditure
    Explanation: Organizations are moving to SaaS as part of their strategic transformation to reduce on-premises IT infrastructure and reduce capital expenditure.
    ```
    
5. Which of these scenarios are good use cases for Public Cloud? _Select two_.
    - Disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity
    - Applications with stable capacity and resourcing needs
    - Reducing time-to-market for products and services
    - Managing business critical platforms and applications
    ```
    Answer: Disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity,
            Reducing time-to-market for products and services
    Explanation: More and more organizations are using public cloud computing resources to build secondary infrastructures for disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity,
                 Cloud-based applications and platforms free up internal IT teams to focus on building and testing applications, thereby reducing time-to-market for products and services.
    ```
    
6. Private cloud platforms can be implemented internally or externally. What is an external private cloud platform?
    - Platform that is owned, managed, and operated by the organization
    - Virtual Private Cloud or VPC
    - Controlled access and customized security measures.
    - Cloud platform that runs on-premises
    ```
    Answer: Virtual Private Cloud or VPC
    Explanation: When the platform is provisioned over a logically isolated part of a cloud provider’s public infrastructure, and is owned, managed, and operated by the service provider.
    ```
    
7. What do we mean when we say that the Hybrid Cloud is interoperable?
    - Organizations can choose to run their sensitive workloads on a private cloud
    - When there is a spike in demand, a workload running on the private cloud can leverage the additional public cloud capacity
    - The public and private cloud services can understand each other’s APIs, configuration, data formats, and forms of authentication and authorization
    - You are no longer locked-in with a specific vendor
    ```
    Answer: The public and private cloud services can understand each other’s APIs, configuration, data formats, and forms of authentication and authorization
    Explanation: An interoperable Hybrid Cloud gives organizations the flexibility to move workloads freely between the public and private clouds as needs change.
