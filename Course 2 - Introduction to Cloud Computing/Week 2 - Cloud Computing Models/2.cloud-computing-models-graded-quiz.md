# Cloud Computing Models: Graded Quiz

1. Which of the following does NOT represent one of the three main Cloud Service Models referred to in the course?
    - PaaS
    - CaaS
    - IaaS
    - SaaS
    ```
    Answer: CaaS
    Explanation: CaaS can refer to Communications-as-a-Service, Cloud-as-a-Service, or Computing-as-a-Service. But it is not one of the three main Service Models for Cloud in this course.
    ```

2. Which one of the provided options is true for Infrastructure-as-a-Service?
    - Cloud provider manages the physical resources, operating systems, development tools, databases, and business analytics
    - Cloud provider manages the physical resources, the platform resources, applications, and data
    - Cloud provider owns, manages, and maintains the physical resources
    - Cloud provider configures the infrastructure which is managed and maintained by the user/customer organization
    ```
    Answer: Cloud provider owns, manages, and maintains the physical resources
    Explanation: In Infrastructure-as-a-Service, the cloud provider manages the data centers, cooling, power, networking, security, servers, and storage.
    ```

3. Which are some of the key components of cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service? _Select two_.
    - IaaS providers deploy the middleware and install required applications on the virtual machines
    - IaaS providers manage large data centers that contain the physical machines required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them
    - IaaS providers manage the hypervisors and end-users provision the virtual instances
    - IaaS providers manage the hypervisors and provision virtual instances
    ```
    Answer: IaaS providers manage large data centers that contain the physical machines required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them,
            IaaS providers manage the hypervisors and end-users provision the virtual instances.
    Explanation: In most IaaS models, end users do not interact directly with the physical infrastructure but experience it as a service provided to them,
                 The cloud providers manage the hypervisors, but the virtual instances are provisioned by the end-users as per their needs.
    ```

4. Which of the following are essential characteristics of Platform-as-a-Service? _Select two_.
    - Organizations who opt for PaaS still need to configure supporting technologies such as load balancers and databases
    - PaaS clouds provide services and APIs that help developers deliver elastically scalable and highly available cloud applications
    - PaaS offerings support middleware capabilities that assists developers by reducing the amount of code that must be written to expand the application’s functional capabilities
    - In a PaaS model, the provider also takes responsibility for the application code and its maintenance
    ```
    Answer: PaaS clouds provide services and APIs that help developers deliver elastically scalable and highly available cloud applications,
            PaaS offerings support middleware capabilities that assists developers by reducing the amount of code that must be written to expand the application’s functional capabilities
    Explanation: PaaS clouds typically include a variety of capabilities such as APIs for distributed caching, queuing and messaging, file and data storage, workload management, user identity, and analytics, thus eliminating the need to integrate disparate components,
                 PaaS offerings support a range of middleware capabilities, such as application servers, database management systems, integration services, business process management systems, rules engines, and complex event processing systems.
    ```

5. Which one of the following is a key characteristic of Software-as-a-Service?
    - SaaS services do not provide options for user customization
    - Ensure every user has access to the same, centrally located, infrastructure and application code
    - Security, compliance, and maintenance of the software are the responsibilities of the user
    - Single tenant architecture
    ```
    Answer: Ensure every user has access to the same, centrally located, infrastructure and application code
    Explanation: Infrastructure and application code—are all maintained centrally and accessed by all users.
    ```

6. Which of these statements is a characteristic of Public Clouds? 
    - Resources are assigned as per estimated need decided at the time of subscribing for the service
    - The cloud provider provisions the resources and services as needed by individual users
    - A public cloud is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture
    - A public cloud provides a dedicated pool of resources to each of its multiple users
    ```
    Answer: A public cloud is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture
    Explanation: Public cloud is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture that enables users to share computing resources residing outside their firewalls.
    ```

7. Which of the following statements is NOT a correct statement about Private clouds?
    - VPC is an example of a type of Private Cloud
    - Private Clouds can be implemented internally or externally
    - Private Clouds are suitable for workloads that require maximum control and security
    - Private clouds can only be deployed on-premise, in an organization’s own datacenter
    ```
    Answer: Private clouds can only be deployed on-premise, in an organization’s own datacenter
    Explanation: Private clouds can be deployed on-premise as well as over a logically isolated part of a public cloud.
    ```

8. Which of these statements are true of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)? _Select two_.
    - The VPC infrastructure is owned, managed, and operated by the public cloud service provider
    - VPC allows all users of the shared public cloud to access resources in the VPC on need basis; it also allows users of the VPC to access resources of the public cloud
    - VPCs may be provisioned over a cloud service provider’s infrastructure, but the infrastructure is owned, managed, and operated by the enterprise
    - VPCs are provisioned in a logically isolated part of a shared public cloud
    ```
    Answer: The VPC infrastructure is owned, managed, and operated by the public cloud service provider,
            VPCs are provisioned in a logically isolated part of a shared public cloud.
    Explanation: While the infrastructure is tailored to an individual organization’s unique needs, it is still owned, managed, and operated by the public cloud service provider,
                 A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an organization establish its own private and secure cloud-like computing environment in a logically isolated part of a shared public cloud.
    ```

9. If an organization needs to run a highly sensitive and mission critical application with unpredictable performance and capacity requirements, which of the following models would best meet its requirements?
    - On-premise Data Centers
    - Hybrid Cloud
    - Public Cloud
    - Private Cloud
    ```
    Answer: Hybrid Cloud
    Explanation: With a Hybrid Cloud, organizations can choose to run their mission-critical applications on the private cloud while leveraging additional public cloud capacity to accommodate spikes in demand for their application.
    ```

10. Which of the following statements about Hybrid Cloud is NOT correct?
    - Hybrid clouds are only suitable for workloads involving Infrastructure-as-a-Service
    - Hybrid clouds can prevent lock-in to a single Cloud Provider
    - Hybrid cloud is a computing environment that connects an organization's on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single flexible infrastructure
    - Hybrid Clouds allow organizations to leverage the additional public cloud capacity when a workload running on the private cloud has a spike in demand
    ```
    Answer: Hybrid clouds are only suitable for workloads involving Infrastructure-as-a-Service
    Explanation: Hybrid clouds are also being leveraged for other opportunities such as Software-as-a-Service integration, Data and AI integration, enhancing legacy apps, and VM migration.
