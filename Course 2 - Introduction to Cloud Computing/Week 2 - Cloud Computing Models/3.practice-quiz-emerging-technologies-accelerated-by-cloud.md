1. How does Cloud connectivity support IoT devices?
   -Increased latency in reporting and response back
   -Provide a fixed physical location for the data collected from IoT devices
   -The collection point is near devices in motion
   -Draw insights from data collected from the IoT devices and users
```
Answer: The collection point is near devices in motion
Correct! Since IoT devices can be in a state of motion, the Cloud serves as a collection point in closest proximity.
```

2. What is the three-way symbiotic relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud?
   -Making sense of the endless streams of data from IoT devices
   -IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both emerging technologies leverage Cloud's scalability and 
   processing power
   -AI consumes the data produced by IoT devices 
   -Power, scale, dynamic nature, and economics of the cloud resources
```
Answer: IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both emerging technologies leverage Cloud's scalability and 
processing power
Correct! This is the three-way relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud. 
```
3. What is the three-way relationship between blockchain, AI, and the Cloud?
   -Blockchain provides an immutable network allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them.
   -Globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources.
   -Lends trust and transparency to AI by recording the data and variables that go into a decision made in an AI 
   algorithm.
   -Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from the 
   collected data, and Cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to 
   support both technologies.

```
Answer: Blockchain provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decisions made from 
the collected data, and Cloud provides the globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to 
support both technologies.
Correct! This is the mutually beneficial, three-way relationship between Blockchain, AI, and Cloud.```
