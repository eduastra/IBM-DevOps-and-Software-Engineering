# Daily Execution

__Executing the Plan__

- You need to keep the kanban board updated so that everyone knows what you are working on

- It is important to always work on the story with the highest priority that you have skills for

- Working on more than one story at a time may lead to neither story being finished at the end of the sprint 

- The daily stand-up occurs every day for 15 minutes

- Topics not related to the stand-up should be addressed after the meeting

- Each person should be prepared to answer the three stand-up questions:

    - What did I accomplish the previous day? 

    - What will I work on today? 

    - What blockers or impediments are in my way?

__Completing the Sprint__

- A burndown chart shows the measurement of story points completed vs story points remaining for a sprint

- Burndown charts can be used to show progress and forecast the team's probability of achieving the sprint goal

- A sprint review is a demonstration of the features that have been implemented during the sprint

- Feedback from stakeholders is critical to help shape the future of the product

- The backlog is updated based on feedback

- A sprint retrospective is a time to reflect on how the sprint went

- The sprint retrospective is attended by the scrum master and the development team

- The team must feel comfortable to speak freely

- A sprint retrospective must result in changes to improve the next sprint

- Three questions are answered on what went right or wrong:

    - What went well? (keep doing)

    - What did not go well? (stop doing)

    - What should we change for the next sprint?

__Measuring Success__

- High performing teams use metrics to continually improve 

- It is important to be sure that the metrics you use are actionable 

- You should take a baseline before trying to measure change.

- It is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories 

- Unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint 

- Each sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint 

- You should create a new milestone for the next sprint

- The top 4 actionable metrics can be used to improve your teamâ€™s overall performance

    - Mean Lead Time (How long does it take from idea to production?) 

    - Release Frequency (How often can you deliver changes?) 

    - Change Failure Rate (How often do changes fail?) 

    - Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (How quickly can you recover from failure?) 

- Anti-patterns to avoid when practicing Scrum include:

    - No real product owner

    - Teams are too large

    - Teams are not dedicated

    - Teams are too geographically distributed

    - Teams are siloed

    - Teams are not self-managing

- The Scrum health check provides guidelines for measuring a healthy scrum team
