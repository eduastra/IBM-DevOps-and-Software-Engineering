# Thinking DevOps

1. Which of these is associated with social coding, rather than traditional thinking?
    - Using private repositories
    - Sharing code
    - Working in silos
    - Putting all the work in a development branch
    ```
    Answer: Sharing code
    Explanation: Social coding means using other team members’ code and those team members using your code. 
    ```

2. Select the correct statement regarding small batches.
    - Working in small batches came from the Agile Manifesto.
    - Working in small batches results in less feedback than large batches.
    - Working in small batches minimizes waste.
    - Working in small batches takes more time than working in large batches.
    ```
    Answer: Working in small batches minimizes waste.
    Explanation: By quickly gaining feedback, you can minimize producing a product that the customer does not want. 
    ```

3. Which of these is associated with minimum viable product (MVP)?
    - Building in increments
    - An iterative process between developers and the customer
    - Giving the customer exactly what they originally asked for
    - Additional features with bells and whistles
    ```
    Answer: An iterative process between developers and the customer
    Explanation: MVP is the cheapest thing you can do to gain value to test a hypothesis. The customer gets what they want through iteration and experimentation.
    ```

4. What is the Red, Green, Refactor workflow?
    - Writing code first (red), then writing a test for it (green)
    - Writing a failing test case (red), then writing enough code to make the unit test pass (green)
    - Avoiding code failure (red) by writing the most refined, error-free code (green) 
    - Ensuring that no one can call the code (red), then deciding how you want to call the code (green)
    ```
    Answer: Writing a failing test case (red), then writing enough code to make the unit test pass (green)
    Explanation: The Red, Green, Refactor workflow is outputting failing test cases in red and passing test cases in green.
    ```

5. What is behavior driven development (BDD)?
    - Ensuring that each component is working correctly
    - Ensuring that each feature performs a specific task
    - Testing the functions of the system to build it right
    - Focusing on the system as observed from the outside
    ```
    Answer: Focusing on the system as observed from the outside
    Explanation: BDD forces you to think about the behavior of the system from the outside in, focusing on business outcomes. 
    ```

6. Select the statement that correctly describes Gherkin.
    - Exploring the problem domain and collaborating to produce a solution
    - A natural language syntax for defining acceptance criteria
    - Thinking from the inside out
    - Specific technical language for writing tests
    ```
    Answer: A natural language syntax for defining acceptance criteria
    Explanation: The Gherkin syntax is a natural language syntax understood by developers, operations, and customers. 
    ```

7. Which of these is true of a monolith, rather than microservices?
    - Scaling is done independently.
    - Changing a customer table would require coordinating with people on other teams.
    - Multiple instances are split out.
    - Each function would have its own database and keep track of its own state.
    ```
    Answer: Changing a customer table would require coordinating with people on other teams.
    Explanation: With microservices the API allows you to change a database.
    ```

8. Select the correct statement regarding stateless microservices.
    - Stateless microservices maintain a hidden state.
    - Stateless microservices are frequently and easily debugged and patched.
    - Stateless microservices each maintain their own state in separate databases.
    - Stateless microservices are simply threads, not full processes.
    ```
    Answer: Stateless microservices each maintain their own state in separate databases.
    Explanation: Stateless microservices each maintain their own state in a separate database or persistent object store. They are full processes that are easily replaced.
    ```

9. What is monkey testing?
    - Deliberately killing services to see how other services are affected
    - A test that monitors for failure up to a limit before it trips 
    - Avoiding failure at all costs
    - A test that isolates failing services to limit the scope of failure
    ```
    Answer: Deliberately killing services to see how other services are affected
    Explanation: Monkey testing is killing services to see how other services are affected. Failure-inducing tools include Chaos Monkey and Netflix’s Simian Army.
    ```

10. Select the correct statement regarding the bulkhead pattern.
    - Bulkhead patterns are used to deliberately kill services for testing.
    - Bulkhead patterns isolate failing services to limit the scope of failure.
    - Bulkhead patterns are designed to detect a problem and trip to avoid catastrophic failure.
    - Bulkhead patterns monitor up to a limit and trip if they detect failure.
    ```
    Answer: Bulkhead patterns isolate failing services to limit the scope of failure.
    Explanation: Bulkhead patterns isolate failing services and separate thread pools help recovery by directing traffic to active connection pools.
    ```
