__Estimated time needed:__ 5 minutes

Beta company has several teams that maintain their e-commerce website. They have adopted the microservices architecture and organized their teams along business domains so that they have an account team, a product team, an orders team, and a warehouse team.

The account team has decided to give customers a more personalized experience. They want to be able to recommend products a customer might like based on what other customers are buying. They notice that the product team has a similar function for recommending products and accessories that go with what the customer is viewing online.

Jeff, the account team lead, decided to ask Susan from the product team if they could add this new capability to their existing recommendation function. Susan said the product team was very busy and, “It will be about a month before we can get to it.” Jeff asked whether he could make the changes. Susan replied, “Our code repository is private, and we don’t like to give access to people outside our team.”

Jeff didn’t want to wait and instead, had the account team write 100% of the code from scratch. He didn’t think it would be that difficult and that they would be able to do it faster than waiting for the product team to do it. Unfortunately, it was harder than Jeff expected.

Jeff knew Kiet, one of the most experienced product team members, from a previous project and asked if he could help them with the new feature. Kiet spent two weeks reviewing the account team’s code with them and making suggestions that got the account team back on track.

The account team eventually completed the feature. They delivered two weeks later than anticipated, but because they created a completely new feature, each of the five account team members received an Innovative Contribution Award that included a $500 bonus.

Kiet, who never received any credit for his contribution thought to himself, “That’s the last time I help the account team with anything.”
