# Taylorism and Working in Silos: Practice Quiz 1

1. What is Taylorism?
    - Applying science to management, leading to the factory assembly line
    - When workers build individually crafted products
    - Pioneering efforts at automated systems
    - When workers, not managers, determine how work is to be done
    ```
    Answer: Applying science to management, leading to the factory assembly line
    Explanation: Taylorism applied science to management and led to workers working on one step of the process at a time instead of retooling and switching jobs.

2. What is considered best practice in software engineering that is different from civil engineering?
    - It is a best practice in software engineering to finish one process before the next can begin.
    - It is a best practice in software engineering to have multiple handoffs that lead to bottlenecks.
    - It is a best practice in software engineering to complete a project and have the members of the team move on and hand off to another team.
    - It is a best practice in software engineering for the same team to build and maintain the product.
    ```
    Answer: It is a best practice in software engineering for the same team to build and maintain the product.
    Explanation: Software engineers work through the entire development lifecycle.

3. Which of the following describes traditional operations instead of DevOps?
    - Deployment is automated to all environments.
    - Builds are repeatable, leveraging Infrastructure as Code.
    - One-of-a-kind infrastructure is built once and maintained.
    - Processes are re-engineered for high volume and rapid throughput of changes.
    ```
    Answer: One-of-a-kind infrastructure is built once and maintained.
    Explanation: Traditional Ops has a bias toward “build once” and maintain, rather than using repeatable builds.
